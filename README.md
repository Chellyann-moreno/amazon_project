# Project Description: 
This project features a comprehensive dataset documenting Amazon Inc.'s historical stock performance from January 1, 1999, to December 20, 2023. Including daily records of open, high, low, close prices, and trading volumes, the dataset serves analysts, investors, and data enthusiasts for in-depth analyses, trend assessments, and predictive modeling specific to AMZN stock. With structured data points such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Adjusted Close prices, researchers can explore historical trends, build predictive models, and study trading volumes. Users are encouraged to employ the dataset for research, education, and analytical purposes, attributing Yahoo Finance as the source and exercising caution in interpreting historical stock data for decision-making due to market complexities.
